        <p id="par2">The series was filmed in the sitcom format. <b><i>The Night Show Studio</i></b>, as in the case of other programs (<b>“<i>Night Show</i>”</b>, <b>“<i>Saturday Show</i>”</b>, <b>“<i>The Candidate</i>”</b> and others), borrowed this format from American analogues (for example, <b>“<i>Friends</i>”</b>). <b><i>The Night Show Studio</i></b> staff traveled to America in the summer of 2007, met with producers and screenwriters of popular sitcoms, and attended the recording process. In addition, they underwent training at <b>“<i>Warner Brothers Studios</i>”</b> and obtained the right to do this format. The show’s style and humor became the reason for its mass popularity. The first series of the series aired on September 23, 2007. The series aired every Saturday and Sunday at 10 pm on the <b><i>Imedi channel</i></b>.</p>
